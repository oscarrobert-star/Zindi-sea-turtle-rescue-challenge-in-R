# Zindi-sea-turtle-rescue-challenge-in-R

This is my first solo project. This project is not complete and the model used herein is not right. All the predictions are zeros and that is my bond of contention. The guiding material I used is found on this link https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sweep/vignettes/SW00_Introduction_to_sweep.html#step-4-tidy-the-forecast-object
I am open to criticism and corrections. All suggestions on how i could have done it better are welcome.
